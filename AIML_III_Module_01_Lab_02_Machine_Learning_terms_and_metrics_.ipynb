There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance.\n",

However, the validation accuracy of nearest neighbour is twice that of the random classifier. Now let us try another random split and check the validation accuracy. We will see that the validation accuracy changes with the split. This is because the validation set is small and the accuracy is highly dependent on the samples in the validation set. We can get a better estimate of the accuracy by using cross-validation."
